# On this Day

You are looking at my test task, which I am doing for one UA / US IT company. This task is supposed to develop a widget to show which users have a Birthday today. I asked to change the domain to make a widget to present today's historical events from Wiki.

## Implementation

- Widget / App developed using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). So you you can use usual CRA approaches to run this app on your localhost.
- Since I my app will not follow the given design Pixel Perfect, I decided to spent some time on writing my own UI design. Check it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/YWWyHyEycQwDFWIjx2JgW7/This-Day-in-History?node-id=202%3A6&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1).
